# Bergensers Commons — build-your-commons tool

## What this is

A single self-contained HTML file (`index.html`) — no build step, no dependencies,
no framework. It's a small survey/visualization app for a group of ~15 friends deciding
where to buy a shared property in Europe. People fill out a questionnaire on their own
phone, get a short code, send it to whoever's collecting, and the codes combine into
a results dashboard (charts, maps, alignment scoring, per-person breakdowns).

Everything — HTML, CSS, JS — lives in that one file. Keep it that way unless explicitly
asked to split it up; the whole point is that anyone can open it with no server.

## Deploy

Hosted on **Tencent EdgeOne Makers**, Git-connected to this repo. Pushing to `main`
triggers an automatic redeploy — no manual upload step, no build command, output
directory is repo root (`/`).

So the workflow is just: edit `index.html` → commit → push to `main`. That's the whole
deploy pipeline.

```
git add index.html
git commit -m "describe the change"
git push
```

If asked to "deploy," "push," "ship this," or similar — that's it, there's no separate
deploy command to run.

## Things worth knowing before editing

- **Pure ASCII output required.** The file is escaped to contain zero non-ASCII bytes
  (accented characters, em dashes, etc. are stored as `\uXXXX` in JS strings and `&#NNN;`
  in HTML/CSS). This was a deliberate fix for a mojibake bug on the hosting CDN, which
  doesn't reliably serve a charset header. If you add any literal non-ASCII character
  when editing, re-escape it the same way before committing — don't let raw UTF-8 bytes
  back into the file.

- **Forced light color scheme.** `color-scheme: light` plus a `prefers-color-scheme: dark`
  override block. Some in-app browsers (e.g. opened from WhatsApp) auto-dark-mode pages
  that don't declare a scheme, which broke readability. Don't remove this.

- **The share-code format is bit-packed (format "C2"), not JSON.** Every fixed-choice
  field (activities, token spends, tolerances, skills, region picks) is packed into a
  handful of bits each rather than stored as a JSON key. Free text (name, why, deal-
  breakers, write-ins) is stored as raw UTF-8 after the packed block. Encoder is `encode()`
  / `packOne()` / `recBin()`; decoder is `decode()` / `unpackC2()` / `recRead()`. There's
  a fallback chain so older-format codes (a prior JSON-based "C1" format) still decode —
  don't break that fallback.

- **No hyphen in the base64 alphabet.** WhatsApp inserts a literal `-` character when it
  line-wraps a long string with no spaces, which corrupts pasted codes. The custom base64
  alphabet used here (`bin64`/`unbin64`) uses `.` instead of `-` for that reason, and the
  decoder strips any stray `-` on the assumption it's always corruption, never a real
  character. If you touch the codec, preserve this — don't reintroduce `-`.

- **Codes are displayed/copied in grouped chunks** (`grp()`, spaces every 20 chars) so
  chat apps have natural wrap points and don't need to hyphenate at all. The paste/import
  handler tries the *whole pasted blob* as one code before falling back to splitting by
  line — grouped codes contain spaces on purpose, so naive whitespace-splitting will
  shred a single code into garbage fragments. If you touch the paste handler, keep that
  "try whole blob first" order.

- **`unpackC2` validates strictly** — wrong record length or leftover bytes throws, rather
  than silently producing garbage/"anon" entries. Keep it strict; a previous looser
  version produced phantom empty submissions from corrupted paste input.

- **The board (`localStorage`, key prefix `commons:`)** persists submissions on whoever's
  device is collecting them, so codes can be added incrementally over days without
  re-pasting old ones.

- **Map data**: tries to fetch real Natural Earth coastline/border data from a CDN at
  runtime (`upgradeGeo`/`upgradeMap` functions) and falls back to a hand-drawn simplified
  outline if that fetch fails (e.g. offline, or a restrictive sandbox). Both paths must
  keep working.

## Style

Warm, editorial, slightly old-fashioned — serif headings (Iowan Old Style / Palatino
fallback stack), monospace for labels/data, sage-green/paper color palette defined as
CSS custom properties at the top of the `<style>` block. Match this rather than
introducing a different visual language.

## Testing changes

There's no test suite. Before committing a change to the codec or paste logic, sanity-
check with a quick Node one-liner: extract the `<script>` contents, `new Function(...)`
them with stub DOM globals, and roundtrip a sample answer through `encode`/`decode`.
This has caught real bugs before (see the strict-validation and hyphen fixes above) —
don't skip it for anything touching `packOne`/`recBin`/`recRead`/`decode`/`encode`.
